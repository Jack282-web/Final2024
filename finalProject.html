        <p class="subheading">Childhood obesity rates in Central New York rise with age. With obesity rates on the rise in Central New York, people are trying to figure out what to change. Central New York has some of the highest obesity rates of all New York.    </p>

        <h2 class="obesity">Obesity Rates By Age Group</h2>
        <p>A big reason for that is children. Just under 37 percent of all children in Central New York are either obese or overweight from 2017 to 2019. When you break it down, in that same time period just over 33 and a half percent of all elementary school students are either obese or overweight. When you look at the rate for middle and high school students from 2017 to 2019 the rate is just over 41 and a half percent. Take a look at this comparison of the percent of elementary school students overweight in Central New York versus middle and high school students. </p>

        <h2 class="obesity">Why Do Obesity Rates Increase With Age?</h2>
        <p>As students get older, obesity rates seem to increase. Why the boost? The key to figuring that out might be the key to stopping childhood obesity in Central New York. </p>
        <p>Children spend most of their time at school, so the habits and routines that the school systems implement can have drastic effects on obesity rates. Local physical education teacher Gregory Jewett says “living in food deserts and the rise of video games” is the reason why childhood obesity rates are so high. A food desert is an area that has limited access to nutritious food. Jewett also said that “in middle and high school, students can consume more “bad” foods or can buy them whereas elementary students cannot” This leads to a general concern that when children are in elementary school their parents are able to pick and choose what food they eat and can make sure they are getting a balanced diet, as well as plenty of exercise. When children become older in middle and high school, they are the ones deciding what to eat, they can go and get lunch by themselves and their parents have significantly less of a say in what they are eating day in and day out. Jewett also said that video games were a major concern. The PE teacher said that “the rise of video games is replacing playing outside”. Children are playing video games once they get to middle and high school instead of playing games outside.</p>

        <p class="mt-4">Looking at the obesity issue on a national scale, the United States are having similar problems. The United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that just under 20 percent of children ages 2-19 are obese, measured by their BMI. 20 percent is still a massive problem, but a far cry from the just under 37 percent metric that plaques Central New York. </p>

        <h2 class="obesity">How Do We Fix This Problem?</h2>
        <p>To take a look at some of the ways to fix this problem, we can take a look at Tompkins New York, the healthiest region in all of Central New York.</p>
        <iframe title="Total Percent of Healthy students in Tompkins New York" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-CuEnj" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/CuEnj/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="454" data-external="1"></iframe>
        <p>Tompkins county is home to Greatstar food co-op which provides 167 local food options across the region. It gives Tompkins county plenty of access to fresh food and produce. Tompkins county is able to easily avoid being a food desert and in exchange is one of the healthiest counties in all of New York. </p>
        <p>So what is New York trying to do to combat these problems? New York state governor Kathy Hochul is trying to counter these “food deserts” with a new initiative. Hochul recently announced a 10 million dollar food access expansion program to help give people in low income areas access to healthy food. In Central New York it is estimated that every 2 out of 5 households struggle with everyday needs. Schools are trying to get kids outside more. Jewett said that he tries to get students up and moving as much as possible in PE class. It’s a long road ahead for Central New York, but if they want to stop the obesity epidemic, they're going to have to start with the children. </p>
